How to Play Tic Frac Toe? 
Tic Frac Toe is a game with 9 tic tac toes connected by a special rule. When a player chooses a square on a small board, the next player can only choose from the corresponding space on the bigger board. If the corresponding bigger space is full or has been won, the next player can choose from any other space they wish. When a player wins a small tic tac toe board, a big X or O is marked on the big space. The player who connects 3 in a row on the big board wins the game.
